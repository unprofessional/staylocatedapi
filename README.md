# staylocatedapi

This is a draft/dev repo submission, hence the nonsensical commits.  When the core functionality and core security implementations are complete, this project will be trashed and the code base will be recommitted as a fresh repo with an initial commit.  All other commits afterward will be performed via submitted branches (fix/etc, feature/etc, refactor/etc) with subsequent pull requests into master (or dev).

### Installation
Grab from GitHub > Use Eclipse > Import existing Maven Project.  You may need to configure project facets.  Will need to test with a fresh client.  Would also like to consider moving this to IntelliJ with gradle support.  

### SSL
Note that this app is, for the moment, hosted on Heroku.  As such, I've acquiesced to using their Tomcat-wrapper, webapp-runner [https://github.com/jsimone/webapp-runner/tree/tomcat7].  I would have liked to use JBoss AS 7.1 here for the experience, but considering I can host any JBoss application locally with relative ease, this wasn't much of a sacrifice.  Anyway, the bigger implication here is that Heroku offers piggyback SSL by default [https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2012/5/3/announcing_better_ssl_for_your_app] which means no manual SSL configuration was done here, save for a somewhat proprietary approach to redirecting HTTP to HTTPS due to Heroku's web/routing set up [http://stackoverflow.com/a/13649976].

Quote:
`The issue is that Heroku's web/routing tier handles the SSL, and proxies the request to your webapp as plain HTTP. So Tomcat doesn't know the request is secured elsewhere (SSL offloading) RemoteIpValve essentially over-rides the protocol, port and IP address that Tomcat sees (and, in turn, how request.isSecure() is evaluated) by looking at HTTP headers set by the proxying server that handled the SSL.`

 (Heroku gives examples using dbcp.BasicDataSource whereas I simply use jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource)

### Classpaths

Eclipse, Maven, and Heroku all seem to have different default classpaths.<br>
- Eclipse: /bin (binary build path, though this appears to be overridden in this project in favor of Maven's own [declared outside of Eclipse via mvn eclipse:eclipse])<br>
- Maven: /target/classes<br>
- Heroku/webapp-runner: / (project root)

This is important to know due to various dependencies and, as discovered, inclusion of properties files in the project

### postgres on Heroku
 postgreSQL version on Heroku is 9.4 --
 Note that a default installation of postgres does NOT come equipped with the features necessary to produce UUIDs (`uuid_generate_v4()`)
 You will need to perform the following steps:
 - Ensure the staylocatedapi app has been pushed and deployed to Heroku
 - Heroku Toolbelt is installed (giving you access to the `heroku` command in command prompt)
 - MS Command Prompt (in project directory):
  - First ensure the database is up and running with `heroku pg:info`
  - Then enter postgres SQL mode with `heroku pg:psql`
  - `CREATE EXTENSION "uuid-ossp";`
 - Create your tables
 
### postgres tables (work in progress, will include sql scripts as part of the project later)

```
-- Table: users

-- DROP TABLE users;

CREATE TABLE users
(
  uuid uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  username character varying(16) NOT NULL,
  email character varying(64),
  user_role character varying(16) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'ROLE_USER'::character varying,
  password character varying(64) NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT users_pkey PRIMARY KEY (uuid)
)
WITH (
  OIDS=FALSE
);

-- Table: contacts

-- DROP TABLE contacts;

CREATE TABLE contacts
(
  requester_id uuid NOT NULL,
  accepter_id uuid NOT NULL,
  time_added timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  CONSTRAINT contacts_pkey PRIMARY KEY (requester_id, accepter_id)
)
WITH (
  OIDS=FALSE
);

-- Table: contact_requests

-- DROP TABLE contact_requests;

CREATE TABLE contact_requests
(
  sender_id uuid NOT NULL,
  recipient_id uuid NOT NULL,
  status integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, -- 0 - Pending...
  time_sent timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  CONSTRAINT contact_requests_pkey PRIMARY KEY (recipient_id, sender_id)
)
WITH (
  OIDS=FALSE
);

-- Table: profiles

-- DROP TABLE profiles;

CREATE TABLE profiles
(
  user_id uuid NOT NULL,
  first_name character varying(64),
  last_name character varying(64),
  description character varying(512),
  CONSTRAINT profile_pkey PRIMARY KEY (user_id)
)
WITH (
  OIDS=FALSE
);
```

### OAuth Implicit Grant process steps

1) https://staylocatedapi.herokuapp.com/oauth/token?grant_type=password&client_id=my-trusted-client&username=regular&password=1234567890

2) https://staylocatedapi.herokuapp.com/oauth/token?client_id=my-trusted-client&grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=xxxxx
	The refresh_token will be different, of course, but this is what you send in order to receive the access_token in order to access the API resource

3) https://staylocatedapi.herokuapp.com/users/examples?access_token=xxxxx

### Password Hashing+Salt
Originally, a Java class was implemented that made use of PBKDF2 to hash and SecureRandom to generate the salt with the salt stored in a separate column in the user table (https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm).

Then it was discovered that Spring Security 3.0+ has built in passwordEncoder support, including a much more streamlined algorithm, BCrypt, which basically strings everything together in a single string, no longer necessitating a separate password_salt column.

Furthermore, while not currently implemented, it is possible to encrypt passwords on the database level (http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/pgcrypto.html & http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2647158/how-can-i-hash-passwords-in-postgresql).
